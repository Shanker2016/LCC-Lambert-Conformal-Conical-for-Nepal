# LCC-Lambert-Conformal-Conical-for-Nepal

1. Explains of formula/equation of LCC.

2. Compute and analyze distortion factor caused by LCC over Nepal

## What are parameters of LCC projection?
For 2SP (2 standard parallels) LCC projection:
1. SP1 - Standard Parallel 1
2. SP2 - Standard Parallel 2
3. Longitude of Origin
4. Latitude of Origin
6. False Easting
7. False Northing

## How do we choose SP?
General rule of choosing SPs is: Parallels of latitude which is 1/6th and 5/6th below the uppermost latitudinal bound.
